        <h4>BTS's music is also a success because of the subject of their music. While many K-pop songs are about
            relationships and love,
            BTS covers subjects that other bands may not like bullying, elitism, and mental health. Their ability to be
            relatable,
            humble while still being entertaining is rare.</h4>

            Why they give me inspiration?
        </h1>

        <p>
            I am a fan of BTS since year of 2014. why did I come to like them? Well, at first I really love while they were performing in thier MV's 
            and dance practices. Jungkook is my Bias but I like them all BTS is not BTS if there were lacking to the 7 members. I also often to learn 
            there dance choreographies. Ever since then I always watch them as I grow up from high school until today. There story are very inspiring
            because when they are started they even beg for 200 people to watch their concert for free just to promote their group then now because 
            individual and group hard work they achieve the heights that they could not imagine that they achieve it. Starting from the very bottom
            to the top and became legends. As a fan I am very proud because I am just a normal person dreaming big dreams. Because of them I am 
            also doing my best to achieve my dreams and make it come true. It might be difficult but I will offer my Blood, Sweat and Tears to achieve
            that.
